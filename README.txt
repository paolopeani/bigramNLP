Bigram.java is a bigram-based natural language processor with two main functions:

1. Checking the "validity" of a given text against a chosen sample text. 

2. Generating new text based on a chosen sample text.

The program accomplishes this by first establishing a tree map of all bigrams that exist within the sample text and using
the frequency of the key-result pairs within that map as a basis for the above functions.
